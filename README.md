# Password Generator Starter Code
## Introduction
This is the 3rd module for our coding bootcamp. This week we learned about JavaScript and how to build basic applications. In this application, we are building a password generator that prompts the user on certain conditions to be met in order to make a password. Conditions such as uupper/lower case letters, password length, numbers and special characters.
